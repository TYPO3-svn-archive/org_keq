	# cat=basic/enable/930;             type=options[Easy 1: all in the same directory,Easy 2: same as easy 1 but with storage pid,Clear presented: each record group in one directory at most,Multi grouped: record groups in different directories]; label=Store record configuration: [Easy]: less configuration costs. If you want to link from one record to another, both have to be stored in the same directory. It may be confusing in case of a lot of data. [Clear presented]: each record group has its own directory. I.e. fe_users are in [staff], events are in [calendar]. Disadvantage: you have to configure page TSconfig and you will have some wizards without an add icon and without an list icon. [Multi grouped]: Same like [clear presented], but record groups can have more than one directory. It enables sophisticated access rules. See section "FAQ: Store record configuration" in the manual.
